# model_based_drl

## Components

All main codes are just in the folder. Some code are based on **World Models** and **Homework2 from Deep Reinforcement Learning class at THU**. 

In `./tf_cnn/` and `./tf_rnn/` we have the trained models. 

In `test` there is already a sample run. The image is compressed so it takes some efforts to watch. 

## Usage

To see the results just run `dqn_atari.py` and the frames will be saved in `./test/`. 

To train your own model, just change a few lines in `dqn_atari.py` and run.
